•Differentiate between Statiscally typed and Dynamically typed programming languages and give examples of languages that fall under each category.
1.Statiscally typed programming languages perform type checking at compile time while dynamically typed languages perform type checking at runtime.
2.Statistically typed are languages where variable types are known at compile time while dynaamically typed are those where the interpreter assigns variables at runtime based on the variables value at the time.
3.Examples of statistically typed are Java, C, C++ while example of dynamically typed is JavaScript.

• Differentiate between the JavaScript data types ‘null’ and ‘undefined&nbsp;

1.The JavaScript null is not a global property while undefined is a global property that represents the primitive data value undefined.
2.Null is the intentional absence of the value. It is one of the primitive values of JavaScript. while Undefined means the value does not exist in the compiler.
3.Null is Primitive value in Javascript while Undefined is an ECMAScript1 (ES1) feature.	
4.Null is an object while undefined is a type.
5.Null in JavaScript is an assignment value. You can assign it to a variable while undefined means a variable declared, but no value has been assigned a value.
